If you want to run locally, you will still need to set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the following env variable in `app/.env` file:
```YAML
    API_TELEGRAM = ""
    OPENAI_TOKEN = ""

    MODE = 'polling'
    PORT = '8443'
    CHATGPT_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

    PGDATABASE = ""
    PGHOST = ""
    PGPASSWORD = ""
    PGPORT = ""
    PGUSER = ""

```
